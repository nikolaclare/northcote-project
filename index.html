            <h2>Why Northcote?</h2>
            <h3>Home of the coolest street in the world for 2024</h3>
            <p>The inner north reigns supreme once again, beating out trendy strips in Tokyo, Barcelona and New York
              City.
              High Street, which weaves through the suburbs of Northcote, Thornbury and Preston, has landed in the
              number
              one position, stealing the crown from Hollywood Road in Hong Kong, East Eleventh in Austin, Guatemala
              Street
              in
              Buenos Aires and Commercial Drive in Vancouver (which rounded out the top five, respectively).</p>
            <p>So what makes High Street so damn cool? This is a strip that has cemented its gold medal status thanks to
              an
              abundance of offerings that appeal to both locals and visitors alike. It's a street where vintage stores and cool
              caf√©s
              sit comfortably
              alongside a food truck park and boutique indie cinema.
            </p>
            <p>Another must-do on High Street is to catch a gig at one of the many live music venues. Best of all, it's easily accessible from the CBD via the 86 tram line - a route so beloved it
              scored its
              very own music festival last year.</p>
